# Battle Wizards Arena
Implemented algorithm inspired by: http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/

Battle Wizards Arena is a personal interest project, with the goal of providing fun and interesting gameplay, in addition to allowing me experiment with game mechanics I am interested in.

This project is an experiment with procedural map generation. Specifically, the Marching cubes algorithm is in development to create landscape and interesting map details. Currently can generate a surface and be edited by the player at runtime (both networked if multiple players in game). 

The game is a wizard based arena shooter. With instead of using guns, like in traditional arena style games, I let the player experiment with casting a variety of spells (Once they are implemented). The goal of this game is to allow the player to pick from many different spells from a variety of schools, to give the player the possiblity to personalize their playstyle.

Future additions to this project include adding more efficient and versitile workflow, enhancing the visuals of the terrain, and an implementation of the procedural structres using marching cubes in conjunction with a wave function collapse algorithm.
